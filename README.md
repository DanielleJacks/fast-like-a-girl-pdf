ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ *Fasting has gained popularity for offering a myriad of health benefits: It can improve your immune system, help you lose or maintain a healthy weight, and enhance your mental clarity*

+  In Fast Like a Girl, best-selling author, YouTuber, and holistic health expert Mindy Pelz suggests that many women fail to benefit from fasting because they don't understand how hormonal cycles impact their bodies.

Pelz argues that aligning fasting schedules with hormonal cycles can help women overcome these challenges and maximize the benefits of fasting

Additionally, we'll supplement her ideas with research, advice, and practical tips from other health and nutrition experts
